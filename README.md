# Scenario
```
A member of your team has developed a self-contained Very Exciting Guestbook in Python that requires deployment to a Production environment so the general public can visit it.
The Guestbook consists of 3 pages:
● a home page where visitors are invited to enter their name and keeps a count of the number of page views
● a submission/'Thanks' page for visitors that have entered their name
● a 'Visitors' page where previous visitors to the website are listed
Names of visitors to the site are stored in MySQL, and number of page views are stored in redis.
Your team member has also included a docker-compose.yml they used to assist in the development of the Guestbook, and can be used to quickly get the project up and running.
